Venturimeter  is a device used for measuring the rate of flow of a fluid
flowing through a pipe. It consists of three parts:

• A short converging part
• Throat
• Diverging part
Let d1 = diameter at the inlet
p1 = pressure at section 1
v1 = velocity at section 1
A1= area at section1
d2, p2, v2, A2 are the corresponding values at the throat.

A1*v1=A2*v2
				H={(v2+v1)(v2-v1)}/2g
coefficient of discharge=(coeficient of venturimeter)*A1*A2(2gh/A12-A22)1/2
